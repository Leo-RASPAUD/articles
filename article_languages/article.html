		<h4>Which scripting language should we use?</h4>
		<p class="strongColor">
			<strong>
			As a developper it's a question that you often have to ask, since a good developer is a lazy developer (<a href="http://threevirtues.com/">Three virtues</a>) we usually use the language that we "master" but is it always a good solution ?
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span>In our application we have the following stack :</span>
			<ul>
				<li>AngularJS for the webapp</li>
				<li>Java for the backend</li>
				<li>MongoDb for our database</li>
			</ul>
			<span>
				During our development phase we often have to develop some scripts to update our database, change the configuration etc. and have to ask ourselves which language should we use.<br/>
				We currently have 3 types of scripts (of course the following languages can be useful in many other cases but we will keep the scope to the scripting in this article) : <br/>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js">NodeJS</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groovy_(programming_language)">Groovy</a></li>
				</ul>
			</span>
		</p>

		<h3><strong>Basics</strong></h3>
		<table class="tableBasics">
			<thead class="strongColor" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
				<tr>
					<th>Python</th>
					<th>NodeJS</th>
					<th>Groovy</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody class="contentTableBasics">
				<tr>
					<td>1991 - Last version : 3.6.0 - December 2016</td>
					<td>2009 - Last version : 7.4.0 - January 2017</td>
					<td>2003 - Last version 2.4.7 - June 2016</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Package manager : PIP</td>
					<td>Package manager : NPM</td>
					<td>Allow the use of java libraries</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Object oriented language</td>
					<td>Javascript</td>
					<td>Java</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Easy to learn</td>
					<td>Easy to use if you know javascript</td>
					<td>Easy to use if you know Java</td>

				<tr>

				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

		<h3><strong>Statistics</strong></h3>
		<p>
			Every year stack overflow does a big survey (~50 000 votes) to analyze different aspects of a developer work, you can see below the most popular technologies.<br/>
			<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology-most-popular-technologies">Check it out!</a>
		</p>
		<img src="img/stack.png">
		<p>
			So, what does this chart teaches us?<br/>
			We can see that only 0.34% of the answers are about Groovy, it's probably biased as Groovy uses Java, but what's more interesting is that Java and Python are almost at the same level (roughly 30%) and NodeJS 17.2% (but uses Javascript).<br/>
 			It means that we have the majority of the developers who are able to develop with at least one of these 3 languages which is interesting when you think about the maintenability of your scripts.
 		</p>

 		<h3><strong>Real life example</strong></h3>

 		<p>
 			In order to compare the three languages, we developed a simple algorithm which find a document in our mongoDb database, updates it and then find it again to show the result.
 		</p>

 		<table class="tableBasics">
 		<thead class="strongColor" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
				<tr>
					<th>Python</th>
					<th>NodeJS</th>
					<th>Groovy</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody class="contentTableBasics">
 				<tr>
	 				<td>
	 					<a href="#" onclick="document.location='img/python-update-db-mongo-large.png';return false;" >
						    <img src="img/python-update-db-mongo-small.png">
						</a>
	 				</td>
	 				<td>
	 					<a href="#" onclick="document.location='img/nodejs-update-db-mongo-large.png';return false;" >
						    <img src="img/nodejs-update-db-mongo-small.png">
						</a>
	 				</td>
	 				<td>
	 					<a href="#" onclick="document.location='img/groovy-update-db-mongo-large.png';return false;" >
						    <img src="img/groovy-update-db-mongo-small.png">
						</a>
	 				</td>
 				</tr>
 				<tr style="border-top: 1px solid #1a566e;">
 					<td class="strongColor performances">~10ms</td>
 					<td class="strongColor performances">~40/50ms</td>
 					<td class="strongColor performances">~15/20ms</td>
 				</tr>
 			</tbody>
 		</table>

 		<p>
 			On those examples we can see that:
 			<ul>
 				<li>Python uses the less lines</li>
 				<li>The async behaviour of NodeJS makes the algorithm harder to understand for people who are not used of reading Javascript</li>
 				<li>The queries are more complicated to write in Groovy</li>
 				<li>Python and NodeJS have a syntax similar to mongo</li>
 			</ul>
 			As a conclusion, <strong>in this example</strong> we can see that the simpler language seems to be Python.<br/>
 			I would personnaly recommend Python because of his simplicity, even though NodeJS allows us to directly use JSON object.<br/>
 			We can see that NodeJS is significantly slower than the two others languages.
 		</p>

 		<h3><strong>Performances</strong></h3>

		<p>
			Depending on the use case, looking at the performances can be interesting while comparing different languages.<br/>
			We've already seen in our previous example that nodeJS seems to be slower than the two other languages, now we will compare the performances<br/>
			on differents algorithms.
		</p>
		<img src="img/algo.png">
		<p>
			<strong>Source</strong> : <a href="http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/">http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/</a><br/>
			We can see that nodeJS and Java are faster on 3 of the 4 algorithms, but each language has his own specifity.<br/>
			What's really interesting is the CPU load, nodeJS uses less CPU than the other 2, it can be useful if your program does heavy calculations for example.<br/>
		</p>

		<h3><strong>Conclusions</strong></h3>
		<p>
			<strong>So now, which scripting language do I chose?!</strong><br/>
			I don't think that there is a good answer to this question, it always depends on the use case.<br/>
			To chose a language, in my opinion you need to answer the following questions :
			<ul>
				<li>What kinds of languages are my team comfortable with?</li>
				<li>What kind of applications do I want to build?</li>
				<li>Do I really need to take the performances in consideration?</li>
				<li>How easy is it to recruit for this platform?</li>
			</ul>
			When the team has answered those questions, just pick a language and stick with it, coherence is the key, don't use 3 different languages to do the same things.<br/>
		</p>
